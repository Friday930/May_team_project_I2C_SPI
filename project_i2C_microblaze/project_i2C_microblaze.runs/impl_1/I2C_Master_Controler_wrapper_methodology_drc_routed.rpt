2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-54#1 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks I2C_Master_Controler_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/DRCK and clk_out1_I2C_Master_Controler_clk_wiz_1_0 (see constraint position 4 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#2 Critical Warning
Scoped false path or clock group constraint between clocks  
A scoped Clock Group timing constraint is set between clocks I2C_Master_Controler_i/mdm_1/U0/Use_E2.BSCAN_I/Use_E2.BSCANE2_I/UPDATE and clk_out1_I2C_Master_Controler_clk_wiz_1_0 (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope. 
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) sda direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (sda) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#1 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) I2C_Master_Controler_i/sda direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (sda_OBUF) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell I2C_Master_Controler_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) I2C_Master_Controler_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sda relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on usb_uart_rxd relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on ready relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on scl relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on usb_uart_txd relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>
